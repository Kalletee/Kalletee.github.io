      <div class="second"><h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>As a person, I am talkative and in general I feel that I always get along well with all kinds of people. Co-operation with colleagues and customers is always a pleasure. 
          <br><br>
          I have gained strong and verstile experience of commissioning carried out on site in different parts of the world, some in less pleasant places. In other words: Traveling for work is not a problem for me, but I see it as an opportunity. 
          <br><br>
          In the past years, my work has often been related to several on-going delivery projects and I truly understand the reality of project management world. 
          My strength definitely is the ability to adapt to challenging situations and I always trust that I can resolve the given challenge.
          <br><br>
          In the end, I especially hope to be able to deepen and refine my already existing skills. I feel that the opportunity for professional development is extremely important. Every day there is something new to learn.
          </p>
          <h5>Perhaps, this would be a great opportunity for you as a company representative and for me as a job seeker, which should not be missed..!</h5>
